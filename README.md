  ## Description

  Kitchen Buddy is a React application that makes your life easier in the kitchen. Our goal is to consolidate commonly sought after cooking knowledge into one easy-to-use application. This will save our users the time and avoid the frustration of having to make multiple searches or even purchases for resources that can many times be spread out and prove difficult to find. Our app currently includes a measurement converter, ingredient substitutions, a cooking timer, and looking up and saving your favorite recipes.
